# Pac_Man
My Pacman project that I did with c# as my final project in 9th grade Computer Science
This version is a little different from the original game that we all know and love
## Rules 
1. There are four levels to this game, and the level you are on correspondes to the number of ghosts chasing you
2. You have 3 lives, everytime you get hit you lose a life, every dot (cookies) he ate goes back where it and the positions of Pacman and the however many ghosts there are on the screen's locations are reset.
3. If you run out of the lives it is game over.
4. If you press the 'esc' key anytime you want to exit the game (but won't pause or save your progress).
